### Quantization

* XNOR-Net: ImageNet Classification Using Binary Convolutional Neural Networks

  > A classic paper for binary neural network saying all weights and activation are binarized.
  > 
  > Implementation: [MXNet](https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet-v2), [Pytorch](https://github.com/jiecaoyu/XNOR-Net-PyTorch), [Torch](https://github.com/allenai/XNOR-Net) (origin)
  
* DoReFa-Net: Training Low Bitwidth Convolutional Neural Networks with Low Bitwidth Gradients
  > Full stack quantization for weights, activation and gradient.
  > 
  > Implementation: [Tensorpack](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/DoReFa-Net)
